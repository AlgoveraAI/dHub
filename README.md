# Algovera dHub

There are several existing Web2 hubs for datasets, models, apps and other assets, such as [Google AI Hub](https://aihub.cloud.google.com/u/0/), [HuggingFace Hub](https://huggingface.co/AlgoveraAI) and [ActiveLoop Hub](https://www.activeloop.ai/). There also exist Web3 marketplaces - such as the Ocean [Marketplace](https://market.oceanprotocol.com/) - that facilitates ownership and monetisation of private datasets and algorithms. However, all of these solutions currently rely on centralised storage and compute providers. The aim of dHub is to create a decentralized hub for machine learning assets where data scientists can store, share and explore using cheaper decentralized storage solutions, as well keeping ownership of (and optionally, monetizing) their creations.
